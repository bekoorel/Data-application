# Movie_App

### This is a simple application for organizing the code to fetch data from the Internet and displaying it on two pages, and simplifying and organizing the definition of the variables carrying the colors used in the application. The files were organized in an exaggerated way to use this application later if we want to enlarge this project after that.
